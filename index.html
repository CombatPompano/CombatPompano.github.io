        <p class = "paragraph"> Maple trees next to a heritage site, Mount Koyo ^^^ </p>
        
        <h2 class = "header"> What are the best things to do in Japan?</h2>
        
    <p class = "paragraph"> Well, you are in luck, since I made you a very detailed list on what you can enjoy while you stay in this foreign country. Scroll below to see it! </p>    
    
    <ul>
    Eat some of Japan's favorite foods! For example, if you like spice, then sushi is a good choice for you!      
    </ul>

    <ul>
    Or, you can even read manga! Manga are Japanese comics that can also be written in english so you can read them. Many come from anime, one of the main sources of TV for the Japanese people. I personally recommend One Piece if you like action :)    
    </ul>
